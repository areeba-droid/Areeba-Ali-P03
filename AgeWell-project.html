              <br>
              This project was done for the IAT 334 course final project, where we were given 7 weeks to research, ideate, design, wireframe, prototype and user test an app for seniors aged 75+. We spent a lot of time researching our target audience and trying to understand their needs so that we could design an app to address them. We chose to make a healthcare app where they could set reminders for events and medications and log their medical history to keep a set record of it. My roles in this project were to work with my team members to ideate possible apps, do research, wireframe and create a style guide, prototype the app on ProtoPie and conduct user interviews to find and fix any flaws in our app. One problem that we faced was creating a colour palette that would be high-contrast but still nice to look at. We solved this issue by testing multiple colour palettes and putting them into greyscale to check their contrast and visibility. Another challenge that we had while working on this app was creating an interface simple enough for the elderly to understand. This meant all of our icons had to be very simple and labelled to avoid confusion, which I was not used to doing usually. Working on this project helped me learn how to design interfaces for the elderly, as well as how to use Protopie to prototype apps. I also got a lot of practice pitching our ideas as well as research and the progress we made with it. In the future, I would spend more time doing initial research for the user group, since the app we made was very similar to other apps made by my peers in that class. I would also spend more time on the actual prototype to make sure everything worked perfectly and smoothly during pitches or user tests.
