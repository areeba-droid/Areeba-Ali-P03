            <p>This project was done for the course IAT 334:
            Interaction Design as the final project. We were
            given seven weeks to create an app for seniors aged 75+.
            The purpose of this was to refine and test our researching,
            designing, prototyping and user testing skills.</p>

          <p>

            During the first two weeks on this project, the team conducted extensive research
             on our user group to find out what they needed. Through this research, I found
             some common needs, goals and activities such as keeping track of health and medication,
             accessing medical history, as well as remembering to take medications on time.
            <br>
            <br>
            With this research in mind, we decided to create a healthcare logging app, which allows
             users to track specific symptoms as well as medications, appointments and reminders.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since we were designing for a specific audience of users aged 75 and up, we also
            did research on how they interact with technology and what difficulties they come
            across while doing so, so that my team and I could create an ideal user experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through this research I found that interfaces need to be kept simple to avoid
            confusion and that icons and buttons need to be labelled and easily differentiable
            since elders may not recognize them as easily. I also found that the ability to
            differentiate color contrast significantly decreases with age, so our color palette
            had to be high contrast which I tested by converting mockups with different colors
            into greyscale.
            <br>
            <br>
            Keeping all this in mind, we came up with a user persona and style guide for our brand.

        <p>
          After getting positive feedback on our research and domain, we started with the initial
          sketching and wireframing of the interface. We kept a minimum of 16pt font for readability,
           had bigger buttons to prevent mis-clicks, and outlined or filled important buttons to
            differentiate them from other content.
