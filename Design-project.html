        <p><strong>Overview:</strong>
          <br>
          For this project, we were tasked with creating a company that provides a product or
          service and designing a webpage for it. The company we came up with was a design studio
          that provides design services as well as sells prints of other designs.
        Some challenges we faced while working on this project were creating a layout for the pages,
          and figuring out which of the content would look best where. For example, we werenâ€™t sure how
          to layout the shop page on which the prints are sold, while also making it look consistent as
          the user scaled it. In the end, we decided to go with a 4 column layout that shrinks to 2 columns
          and then 1 column when the page is scaled to the smallest size. Another challenge we faced was
          translating the webpage to a mobile page, which we solved by making the layout only a single column.
        By working on this project, I was able to learn how to use GitHub, as well as how to code responsive webpages using HTML and CSS. </li>
        If I were to go back and make changes to this project, I would change the mobile layout to
          have bigger text and buttons to make it easier for the user.
