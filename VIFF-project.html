          This project was done for the IAT 235 course final project, where we were given around 1 month to research, ideate, design, wireframe and develop a microsite based on an already existing website. We chose to make a site for all the directors who would be present at the 2022 Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF). We did research on VIFF through their website and gathered information on the directors by looking at their social media sites such as Instagram or LinkedIn to help get better insight into who they were as well as their values, inspirations and film styles. One challenge that we had with this website was narrowing down to a specific user base since the film industry is very broad, but we ended up designing the site for film students or new graduates who were looking to expand their connections in the industry through networking. We decided we could connect these students with the directors at VIFF to get insight into their film journeys while forming everlasting connections. Another challenge we faced was that we were unexpectedly restricted to only 2 pages on our website, so we had to alter our design and condense it very last minute to fit the Webflow page limit. Through this project, I learned the basis of HTML and CSS, as well as how to use Webflow to prototype and develop a website. Through this project, I was able to learn to design based on a specific user persona, but if I were to go back and redo this project I would change the user persona to reflect more of the large user base that the Vancouver International Film Festival has.
