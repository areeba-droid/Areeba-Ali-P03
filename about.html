    <section class="about-info">
      <p>I am a third-year student at Simon Fraser University, pursuing a B.A. in Interactive Arts and Technology,
        concentrating in design. I am interested in user interface and user experience design, but I also love doing
        visual and product design and would love to expand my skillset into other branches of design. Watching a design
        piece slowly come to life through iterations and testing is one of my favourite parts of being a designer.

        Outside of design, I have a lot of creative hobbies, like crocheting, sketching, baking, reading and jewelry-
        making! I recently started a small business with my jewelry and am slowly learning how to take product photos,
        create a consistent brand identity and market products. Other than that, I like to get involved with my community,
        and I recently volunteered as a director of events for the Interactive Arts Student Unionâ€™s FROSH event for the
        incoming first years.
